# YouTube Music Playlist

This project will allow you to make a music playlist from the given songs.

# Prerequisites

Python 3

# How to run the script

The user will start the script by entering the correct username and password. The username is "MusicFan'03" and the password is "hunter1". The user will have three attempts to get the correct username and password and if they don't, the program will end. Once the valid login is entered three different playlists will come up, and the user will get to pick one. Once a playlist is chosen it will display 5 songs at a time; if the playlist has less than 5 songs it will show all of them. For a playlist with at least 6 songs, they are asked if they want to see more of the playlist. Once they've seen the songs they will have 3 actions. If action 1 is chosen the playlist will shuffle and the song arrangements will be different. If action 2 is chosen the playlist will be shortened, so 1 song will be removed. If action 4 is chosen the program ends.
